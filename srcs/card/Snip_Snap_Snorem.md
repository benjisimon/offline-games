# Snip Snap Snorem

## Goal

Get rid of all your cards first.


## Setup

Deal out cards, one at a time, to each playiner until all the cards have been dealt.

Pick someone to go first. The play puts down a card of their choice.

## Game Play

The next player must either:

* Put down a card that matches the same rank
* Say 'skip' and skip their turn

Players will put down cards of the same rank by saying:

* first card - nothing
* second card: 'snip'
* third card: 'snap'
* fourth card: 'snorem'

The player who puts down the 'snorem' card gets to put down the next card which sets the rank everyone else must match.

The first person out of cards is the winner.
