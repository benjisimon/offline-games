# Horse Race

## Goal

Pick the winning horse.

## Setup

Find all 4 aces, shuffle the remaining cards and make the following
game board

```
  C C C C C C C
A
A
A
A
```

That's the four aces, which are the horses and the 7 cards across the
top which are used to mark the course.

If there are five or more cards of the same suit in the top row, the
cards are reshuffled, cut and dealt again, since it would be
impossible for the horse of that suit to win.

Take bets.

## Game Play

* Reveal the top card in the deck
* Put it in the horizontal line with the Ace that matche its suit
* Repeat

When one suit finally has 8 cards in a row, it will have crossed the
finish line and that horse will have one.

Pay people according to the odds.

## Odds

More cards of suite in the top row means that it's less likely that
horse will win.

For each suite, look how many are in the top row:

* 0 cards: 1-1
* 1 cards: 2-1
* 2 cards: 3-1
* 3 cards: 5-1
* 4 cards: 10-1
