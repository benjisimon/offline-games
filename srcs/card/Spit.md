# Spit

## Setup

Deal out all the cards to two people.

Each player deals out 5 stacks in front of them. The stacks have:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

cards respectively.

Turn over the top card in each pile.

Each player puts the remaining cards in front of them to form a stock pile.

## Game Play

* Say spit and take the top card of your spit pile and up it in the center to form two spit piles

* Move face up card on from your stock pile to a spit pile. It must be
  1 more or 1 less than the currently value of the spit pile. (Suite and color don't matter)
  
* Turn over the next card in the stack so 5 cards always show in the stack.

* If a stack is empty, you can move a card from one stack into that
  spot and turn over a card in your pile.

* Can only have 5 stacks

* Use one hand to play

* If no player can make a play, then both players say spit and place a
  card from their stock pile onto the spit pile
  
  
* Once a player has played all their stacks, they slap either spit
  pile. That spit pile is added to theri stock pile.

* The other player takes the other spit pile, and the cards form their
  stacks and adds them to their stock pile.

* New stacks are dealt and play repeats.
