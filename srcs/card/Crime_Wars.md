# Crime Wars

## Setup

You need a deck, die and score card.

Pick a suite. That's your team. Different teams have different attack abilities.

Find your King. That's your kingpin. Keep him alive.

Each team starts with $1000.

It costs $100 to hire one thug.

Shuffle the remaining cards.

Each player picks two cards from their deck and doesn't reveal them.

## Game Play

* Draw a card and put it in your hand.

* Check if it's a special card and show it:
  * Queen: Adds 1 attack point to team.
  * Jack: Adds 1 defense point to team.
  * Ace: Adds $1000 to team.
  * Put the card at the bottom of your deck

* Choose to hire any number thugs from your hand.
  * A numbered card represents a number of thugs
  * If you have a 5 in your hand, you can pay $500 to buy those thugs.
  * If you owe money, you can use the thugs in your hand to pay that debt.

* Attack another player
  * Select the thugs from your team
  * Select the thugs you wish to attack from other person's thugs
  * Roll die
  * Multiply the attack stats of the attack group
  * Multiple the defense stats of the defense group
  * If the attack score is higher, then the defending thugs are wiped off the board
  * If the defense score is higher, then it's as if the attack never happened.
  
* When all the thugs have been killed you can attack the Kingpin
  * Kingpins are worth 2x the defense of a thug
  * If you kill the kingpin, you get all of the player's money
