## Goal

Golf is a card game for two or more players, in which the object is to
score as little as possible, as in the sport of Golf.

## Setup

* The dealer deals four cards to each player, one at a time.
* Each player's cards are to be arranged face down in a square. 
* The remaining undealt cards are placed face-down in the centre of
  the table to form a drawing stock.
* The top card of the stock is turned face up and placed beside the
  stock to start the discard pile. 
* Before play begins, each player may look once at the two nearest
 cards of his or her square layout, without showing them to anyone
 else.
* After this, the layout cards may not be looked at again until they
  are discarded during play or scored at the end of the play.
  
## Game Play

* The player to the dealer's left begins, and the turn to play passes
 clockwise
* At your turn you must either:
 * draw the top card of the face-down stock
 * draw the top discard 
 * knock to cause the play to end.
* If you ...
  * If you draw a card, you may use it to replace one of the four cards
    of your layout, but you are not allowed to look at any of your
    layout cards before deciding which to replace. You place the drawn
    card face-down in your layout, being careful to remember what it is,
    and discard the card that previously occupied that position, putting
    it face-up on top of the discard pile. It is then the next player's
    turn.
  * If you draw a card from the stock and decide that you do not want to
    use it in your layout, you may simply discard the drawn card face up
    on the discard pile, and it is then the next player's turn. However,
    if you choose to take the discard, you must use it to replace one of
    your layout cards - you cannot simply put it back on the discard
    pile, leaving the situation as it was.
  * If you knock, you do nothing else in your turn. Each of the other
    players in order has one more normal turn (in which they draw a card
    from the stock or discard pile but cannot knock) and then the play
    ends.
* Note that if you look at any face down card in your layout, that
  card must be discarded replaced with the card you drew. There is no
  way to check the value of a face down card and leave it in place.
  
## Scoring

At the end of the play, each player's square of four cards is turned face-up and scored as follows.

* Each numeral card scores face value (Ace=1, Two=2, etc.)
* Each Jack or Queen scores 10 points.
* Each King scores zero points.

# Conclusion

The player who has the lowest cumulative score after nine deals wins.
