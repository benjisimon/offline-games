# The Mind

## Setup

All players form a single team. 

In the first round (level 1) each player receives 1 card, in the
second round (level 2) they receive 2 cards, and so on.

## Game Play

At each level the team members must put down all their cards in
increasing order in the center of the table on an open stack, one
after the other. For example (4 players, level 1): 18-34-41-73. The
players do not take turns in any particular order.
