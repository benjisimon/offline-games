# Ninety-Eight

## Goal

The aim is to avoid taking the value above 98. The first person who
makes the value of the pile more than 98 loses.

## Setup

* Deal out four cards to each player
* Place the remainder face down to form the stock. 
* The player to the dealer's left begins and play continues in clockwise order. 


## Game play

* Players play their cards on the table to form a face-up pile alongside the stock.
* At your turn you play one of your four cards to the face up pile
* Call out the new value of the pile
* Draw the top card from the face down stock to replace the card you
  played.

## Conclusion

* The first person who makes the value of the pile **more** than 98 loses

## Scoring

* ace to nine: increase the value of the pile by the pip count of the card
* ten: reduce the value by ten
* jack, queen: the value stays the same
* king: the value is set to 98

## Example

* The first player plays an 8 and says 8
* The next player plays a 6 and says 14
* The next player plays a king and says 98
* The next player plays a jack and says 98
* The next player plays a ten and says 88
* The next player plays a 7 and says 95
* The next player's four cards are 4, 5, 6, 9 - this player must lose.
