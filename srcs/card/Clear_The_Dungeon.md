# Clear the Dungeon

## Setup

Divide cards in face cards and non-face cards.

Face cards are the monsters. Non-face cards (including jokers) are used for attacking.

Shuffle the face cards and arrange them in 4 stacks, with two cards
down and the top card showing.

Shuffle the non-face cards.

## Game Play

Deal 3 cards from the non-face card deck.

Choose to:

* Build an attack by taking any two cards that add up to the monster's
  value and putting on the monster.
* Trigger the attack by putting any card with the same suite as the
  monster as the 3rd card
* Discard the card

When you use up your 3 cards, deal 3 new cards.

## Conclusion

Either you'll kill all the monsters or you'll run out of cards to deal
yourself and you lose.

## Card Values

* Jack = 11 points
* Queen = 12 points
* King = 13 points
* Ace = 1
* Joker = any value up to 10
