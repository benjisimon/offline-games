## Goal

Get rid of all your cards

## Setup

Deal half the cards to one player, half to another.

## Game Play

Each player deals out 4 cards in front of them. This creates an 2 x 8 grid.

If any of the cards dealt have matching ranks, then players deal cards to cover them.

This process repeats until no more matches are found.

Players then add the cards of their row in front of them to their deck and the process repeats.
