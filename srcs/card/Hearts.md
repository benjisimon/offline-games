# Hearts

## Goal

The object is to avoid scoring points. 

The game is ended by someone reaching or going over 100 points, and
the winner is the player with the lowest score at this point.

## Setup

Need 3+ people.

Adjustments:

* 3 players - remove the 2 of diamonds
* 4 players - remove no cards
* 5 players - remove 2 of diamonds and 2 of clubs

All the cards are dealt out one at a time, so everyone has an equal number of cards.

On the first hand, after the deal, each player passes any three cards
face-down to the player to their left.

When passing cards, you must first select the cards to be passed and
place them face-down, ready to be picked up by the receiving player;
only then may you pick up the cards passed to you, look at them and
add them to your hand.



## Game Play

The person who holds the 2 of clubs must lead it to the first
trick.  If the 2 was removed, use the 3 of clubs. j

The other players, in clockwise order, must play a card of the
suit which was led if possible. If they do not have a card of that
suit, they may play any card. The person who played the highest card
of the suit led wins the trick and leads to the next trick.

Worth noting:

* Collecting hearts or the Queen of Spaces is bad.
* Collecting other cards makes no difference
* You want as few point as possible

It is illegal to lead a heart until after a heart has been played to a
previous trick, unless your hand contains nothing but
hearts.

Discarding a heart, thus allowing hearts to be led in future,
is called breaking hearts.

In general, discarding a penalty card on a
trick is called painting the trick.

Players are permitted to lead spades to any trick after the first. In
fact it is a normal tactic to lead lower spades to try to drive out
the queen. This is sometimes known as smoking out the queen.


## Scoring

Normally, each player scores penalty points for cards in the tricks
which they won. 

* Each heart scores one point, 
* the queen of spades scores 13 points. 

if you manage to win all the scoring cards (which is known as a slam
or shooting the moon), your score is reduced by 26 points, or you may
choose instead to have all other players' scores increased by 26
points.

The game continues until one player has reached or exceeded 100 points
at the conclusion of a hand. The person with the lowest score is then
the winner.

### Jack of Diamonds variation

Many people play that the Jack of Diamonds (or sometimes the Ten of
Diamonds) is a bonus card, counting minus 10 points for the person
taking it.

With this form of scoring, the game is known as Omnibus
Hearts. 

To shoot the moon, you need all the hearts and the Queen of Spades, and as
usual you can choose to have 26 points deducted from your score or
added to everyone else's; in addition to this, 10 points are deducted
from the score of the player who took the Jack of Diamonds (who may be
the same player as the shooter).
