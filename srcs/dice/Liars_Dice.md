# Liar's Dice

## Setup

Each player rolls 5 dice and keeps the results secret.

## Game Play

The players go around in order, each announcing a bid consisting of a
a face (1 through 6) and a quantity. 

The bid must be higher than the previous bid that was made.

Subsequent players must either make new,higher bid or challenge the previous bid.

On a challenge, all dice are shown.

If the bid was matched or exceeded, the player wins. Otherwise, the
challenger wins.

## Ranking

You could play Poker Dice hands, which do not have straights. Or, you could play with straights:

* Five of a kind
* Four of a kind
* Full house (Three of a kind and a pair)
* Three of a kind
* Two pair
* One pair
* Highest single number

(2) 3's is less than (2) 6's.  (3) 1's is greater than (2) 6's.

## Wilds

You could consider some dice, like 1's to be wild. If that wasn't he
face being called, then they stand in for anything.
