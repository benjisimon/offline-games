# Three's Away

## Setup

Need 5 dice.

## Game Play

Player will get up to 5 rolls.

* Roll dice
* Remove all 3's rolled. They are worth 0 points and all must be removed.
* If no 3's were removed, set aside the highest value die

Repeat 4 more times or until you have no dice.

Sum up the dice that were set aside and that aren't 3's.

That's your score for the round.

## Conclusion

Play for rounds, play for the first person to reach X points.

Can also play to see who gets the lowest score, keeping the lowest value die on each roll.
