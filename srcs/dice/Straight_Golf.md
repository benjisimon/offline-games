# Straight Golf

## Setup

5 dice

## Game Play

A round works by rolling three times to make a straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Roll #1:
* Rolling 5 dice
* Set aside any dice that help build a straight

Roll #2:
* Roll any remaining dice
* Sset aside any dice that helps build your straight

Roll #3
* Same as Roll #2

Calculate your score for that round.

Hand to the next play to play the round.

Play 9 rounds.

## Scoring

If you roll a straight (1,2,3,4,5,6) in 3 attempts you get 0 points.

If you roll a striaght in 2 attempts you get a -1.

If you roll a straight in 1 attempts you get a -3.

If you don't roll a straight, add one for each die that doesn't fit the straight

## Example:

Roll #1: 1 2 3 4 4 5

* Set aside: 1 2 3 4 5, re-roll hoping you will roll 6.

Roll #2: 6

* Whoo! You roll the straight. Your score is -1.

Again:

Roll #1: 1 3 4 4 5 3
* Set aside: 1 3 4 5

Roll #2: 2 3
* Set aside 2

Roll #3: 1
* Didn't make a straight

Had one die that didn't make the straight so your score is +1.


## Conclusion

Play 9 rounds and be the player with the lowest score.
