# Ship, Captain and Crew

## Goal

Roll 5 dice 3 times to accumulate the most points

## Setup

* None

## Game Play

* Roll dice
  * If you got a 6, 5, 4 put these 3 dice aside, add remaining two dice as points
  * If you got a 6, 5, put these 2 dice aside
  * If you got a 6, put this dice aside
* You have two more chances to roll the dice
* Once you have rolled 6, 5, 4 and points you can roll the points
  again.
  * You only keep your last point score 
  * You must re-roll all the dice you just rolled.


    
## Example

Player 1:

* Roll #1: [4, 5, 2, 1, 1] - haven't found their ship
* Roll #2: [6, 3, 1, 2, 1] - put aside 6
* Roll #3: [4, 2, 1, 1] - no 5, so no points.

Player 2:

* Roll #1: [1, 6, 4, 4, 1] - rolled 6, 5, 4. Points add up to 2
* Roll #2: [3,4] - earned points
* Roll #3: [1,3] - score is 4 points. 

Player 3:

* Roll #1: [4, 5, 2, 1, 1] - haven't found their ship
* Roll #2: [1, 3, 4, 5, 2] - still no 6
* Roll #3: [6, 5, 4, 6, 6] - found 6,5,4 and earned max score of 12!


## Terminology

Before you can find your captain, you need to find your ship. Before
you can find your crew, you need to find your crew.

* 6 = Ship
* 5 = Captain
* 4 = Crew
