# But why?

This happens too often: I find myself with a group of folks and some
time to kill. I then have two thoughts in quick succession:

1. We should play cards!

2. I immediately forget ever card game I've ever played before

This repo tries to get ahead of this problem by spelling out
interesting games and allowing me to cache the results locally.
